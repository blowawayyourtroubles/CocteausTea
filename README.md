# 🍵Cocteau's Tea
This is a simple and minimalist web project that has been carefully maintained and refined over multiple years. Built entirely 
using: clean HTML for structure, CSS for styling,
and vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation 
for interactivity.

# Design and inspiration
Since this is a really personal project, which aimed 
to attract me directly into programming, as I am also really 
into design, that's why I drew inspiration  from the artistic 
vision of Jean Cocteau and the timeless elegance of Yves Saint Laurent.

**Colors Used:** Deep forest greens (#12221E), warm creams (#F6EFE6), and refined gold accents (#C7A77A)

# Content

* Styling Approach: Centralized CSS with global and page-specific stylesheets.
* Interactivity: Mobile menu, hover animations, form interactions.
* Responsiveness: Optimized across all device sizes with graceful degradation.

>Note I haven't finished this yet. I have to add more interactivity and SCSS.
